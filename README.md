# Coffee_Machine
Jet Brains Academy Coffee Machine Project

Emulates the function of an actual coffee machine, allows a user to buy a coffee, refill its resources, empty the money, and view how much resources are left. 

Good practice for using enumerators, as well as experimentation with static vs instance fields and methods.
